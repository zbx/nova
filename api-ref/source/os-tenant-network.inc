 Project networks (os-tenant-networks) (DEPRECATED)
===================================================

.. warning::

   These APIs are proxy calls to the Network service. Nova has
   deprecated all the proxy APIs and users should use the native APIs
   instead. These will fail with a 404 starting from microversion 2.36.
   See: `Relevant Network APIs
   <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/networking/v2/#networks>`__.

   :language: javascript

Create Project Network
======================

.. rest_method:: POST /os-tenant-networks

.. note::
    This API is only implemented for the nova-network service and will result
    in a 503 error response if the cloud is using the Neutron networking

    service. Use the Neutron ``networks`` API to delete an existing network.
