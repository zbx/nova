Compute API configuration
=========================

The Compute API, run by the ``nova-api`` daemon, is the component of OpenStack
Compute that receives and responds to user requests, whether they be direct API
calls, or via the CLI tools or dashboard.

Configure Compute API password handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenStack Compute API enables users to specify an administrative password
when they create or rebuild a server instance.  If the user does not specify a
password, a random password is generated and returned in the API response.

In practice, how the admin password is handled depends on the hypervisor in use
and might require additional configuration of the instance.  For example, you
might have to install an agent to handle the password setting. If the
hypervisor and instance configuration do not support setting a password at
server create time, the password that is returned by the create API call is
misleading because it was ignored.

To prevent this confusion, use the ``enable_instance_password`` configuration
option to disable the return of the admin password for installations that do
not support setting instance passwords.
