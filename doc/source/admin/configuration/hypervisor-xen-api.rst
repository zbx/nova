XenServer (and other XAPI based Xen variants)
=============================================

This section describes XAPI managed hypervisors, and how to use them with
OpenStack.

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

Xen
---

A hypervisor that provides the fundamental isolation between virtual machines.
Xen is open source (GPLv2) and is managed by `XenProject.org
<http://www.xenproject.org>`_, a cross-industry organization and a Linux
Foundation Collaborative project.

Xen is a component of many different products and projects.  The hypervisor
itself is very similar across all these projects, but the way that it is
managed can be different, which can cause confusion if you're not clear which
toolstack you are using.  Make sure you know what `toolstack
<http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Choice_of_Toolstacks>`_ you want before you get
started. If you want to use Xen with libvirt in OpenStack Compute refer to
:doc:`hypervisor-xen-libvirt`.

XAPI
----

XAPI is one of the toolstacks that could control a Xen based hypervisor.
XAPI's role is similar to libvirt's in the KVM world.  The API provided by XAPI
is called XenAPI.  To learn more about the provided interface, look at `XenAPI
Object Model Overview <http://docs.vmd.citrix.com/XenServer/
6.2.0/1.0/en_gb/sdk.html#object_model_overview>`_ for definitions of XAPI
specific terms such as SR, VDI, VIF and PIF.

OpenStack has a compute driver which talks to XAPI, therefore all XAPI managed
servers could be used with OpenStack.

XenAPI
------

XenAPI is the API provided by XAPI.  This name is also used by the python
library that is a client for XAPI.  A set of packages to use XenAPI on existing
distributions can be built using the `xenserver/buildroot
<https://github.com/xenserver/buildroot>`_ project.

XenServer
---------

An Open Source virtualization platform that delivers all features needed for
any server and datacenter implementation including the Xen hypervisor and XAPI
for the management. For more information and product downloads, visit
`xenserver.org <http://xenserver.org/>`_.

XCP
---

XCP is not supported anymore. XCP project recommends all XCP users to upgrade
to the latest version of XenServer by visiting `xenserver.org
<http://xenserver.org/>`_.

Privileged and unprivileged domains
-----------------------------------

A Xen host runs a number of virtual machines, VMs, or domains (the terms are
synonymous on Xen). One of these is in charge of running the rest of the
system, and is known as domain 0, or dom0. It is the first domain to boot after
Xen, and owns the storage and networking hardware, the device drivers, and the
primary control software. Any other VM is unprivileged, and is known as a domU
or guest.  All customer VMs are unprivileged, but you should note that on
XenServer (and other XenAPI using hypervisors), the OpenStack Compute service
(``nova-compute``) also runs in a domU. This gives a level of security
isolation between the privileged system software and the OpenStack software
(much of which is customer-facing).  This architecture is described in more
detail later.

Paravirtualized versus hardware virtualized domains
---------------------------------------------------

A Xen virtual machine can be paravirtualized (PV) or hardware virtualized
(HVM). This refers to the interaction between Xen, domain 0, and the guest VM's
kernel.  PV guests are aware of the fact that they are virtualized and will
co-operate with Xen and domain 0; this gives them better performance
characteristics. HVM guests are not aware of their environment, and the
hardware has to pretend that they are running on an unvirtualized machine. HVM
guests do not need to modify the guest operating system, which is essential
when running Windows.

In OpenStack, customer VMs may run in either PV or HVM mode.  However, the
OpenStack domU (that's the one running ``nova-compute``) must be running in PV
mode.

XenAPI deployment architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A basic OpenStack deployment on a XAPI-managed server, assuming that the
network provider is neutron network, looks like this:

.. figure:: /figures/xenserver_architecture.png
   :width: 100%

Key things to note:

* The hypervisor: Xen

* Domain 0: runs XAPI and some small pieces from OpenStack,
  the XAPI plug-ins.

* OpenStack VM: The ``Compute`` service runs in a paravirtualized virtual
  machine, on the host under management.  Each host runs a local instance of
  ``Compute``.  It is also running neutron plugin-agent
  (``neutron-openvswitch-agent``) to perform local vSwitch configuration.

* OpenStack Compute uses the XenAPI Python library to talk to XAPI, and it uses
  the Management Network to reach from the OpenStack VM to Domain 0.

Some notes on the networking:

* The above diagram assumes DHCP networking.

* There are three main OpenStack networks:

  * Management network: RabbitMQ, MySQL, inter-host communication, and
    compute-XAPI communication. Please note that the VM images are downloaded
    by the XenAPI plug-ins, so make sure that the OpenStack Image service is
    accessible through this network. It usually means binding those services to
    the management interface.

  * Tenant network: controlled by neutron, this is used for tenant traffic.

  * Public network: floating IPs, public API endpoints.

* The networks shown here must be connected to the corresponding physical
  networks within the data center. In the simplest case, three individual
  physical network cards could be used. It is also possible to use VLANs to
  separate these networks. Please note, that the selected configuration must be
  in line with the networking model selected for the cloud.  (In case of VLAN
  networking, the physical channels have to be able to forward the tagged
  traffic.)

* With the Networking service, you should enable Linux bridge in ``Dom0`` which
  is used for Compute service. ``nova-compute`` will create Linux bridges for
  security group and ``neutron-openvswitch-agent`` in Compute node will apply
  security group rules on these Linux bridges. To implement this, you need to
  remove ``/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-bridge*`` in ``Dom0``.

Install XenServer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run OpenStack with XenServer, you must install the hypervisor on
`an appropriate server <http://docs.vmd.citrix.com/XenServer/
6.2.0/1.0/en_gb/installation.html#sys_requirements>`_.

.. note::

   Xen is a type 1 hypervisor: When your server starts, Xen is the first
   software that runs. Consequently, you must install XenServer before you
   install the operating system where you want to run OpenStack code. You then
   install ``nova-compute`` into a dedicated virtual machine on the host.

Use the following link to download XenServer's installation media:

* http://xenserver.org/open-source-virtualization-download.html

When you install many servers, you might find it easier to perform `PXE boot
installations <http://docs.vmd.citrix.com/XenServer/6.2.0/
1.0/en_gb/installation.html#pxe_boot_install>`_.  You can also package any
post-installation changes that you want to make to your XenServer by following
the instructions of `creating your own XenServer supplemental pack
<http://docs.vmd.citrix.com/
XenServer/6.2.0/1.0/en_gb/supplemental_pack_ddk.html>`_.

.. important::

   Make sure you use the EXT type of storage repository (SR).  Features that
   require access to VHD files (such as copy on write, snapshot and migration)
   do not work when you use the LVM SR.  Storage repository (SR) is a
   XAPI-specific term relating to the physical storage where virtual disks are
   stored.

   On the XenServer installation screen, choose the :guilabel:`XenDesktop
   Optimized` option. If you use an answer file, make sure you use
   ``srtype="ext"`` in the ``installation`` tag of the answer file.

Post-installation steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps need to be completed after the hypervisor's installation:

#. For resize and migrate functionality, enable password-less SSH
   authentication and set up the ``/images`` directory on dom0.

#. Install the XAPI plug-ins.

#. To support AMI type images, you must set up ``/boot/guest``
   symlink/directory in dom0.

#. Create a paravirtualized virtual machine that can run ``nova-compute``.

#. Install and configure ``nova-compute`` in the above virtual machine.

Install XAPI plug-ins
---------------------

When you use a XAPI managed hypervisor, you can install a Python script (or any
executable) on the host side, and execute that through XenAPI.  These scripts
are called plug-ins. The OpenStack related XAPI plug-ins live in OpenStack
os-xenapi code repository. These plug-ins have to be copied to dom0's
filesystem, to the appropriate directory, where XAPI can find them. It is
important to ensure that the version of the plug-ins are in line with the
OpenStack Compute installation you are using.

The plugins should typically be copied from the Nova installation running in
the Compute's DomU (``pip show os-xenapi`` to find its location), but if you
want to download the latest version the following procedure can be used.

**Manually installing the plug-ins**

#. Create temporary files/directories:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ OS_XENAPI_TARBALL=$(mktemp)
      $ OS_XENAPI_SOURCES=$(mktemp -d)

#. Get the source from the openstack.org archives. The example assumes the
   latest release is used, and the XenServer host is accessible as xenserver.
   Match those parameters to your setup.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ OS_XENAPI_URL=https://tarballs.openstack.org/os-xenapi/os-xenapi-0.1.1.tar.gz
      $ wget -qO "$OS_XENAPI_TARBALL" "$OS_XENAPI_URL"
      $ tar xvf "$OS_XENAPI_TARBALL" -d "$OS_XENAPI_SOURCES"

#. Copy the plug-ins to the hypervisor:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ PLUGINPATH=$(find $OS_XENAPI_SOURCES -path '*/xapi.d/plugins' -type d -print)
      $ tar -czf - -C "$PLUGINPATH" ./ |
      > ssh root@xenserver tar -xozf - -C /etc/xapi.d/plugins

#. Remove temporary files/directories:</para>

   .. code-block:: console

      $ rm "$OS_XENAPI_TARBALL"
      $ rm -rf "$OS_XENAPI_SOURCES"

Prepare for AMI type images
---------------------------

To support AMI type images in your OpenStack installation, you must create the
``/boot/guest`` directory on dom0.  One of the OpenStack XAPI plugins will
extract the kernel and ramdisk from AKI and ARI images and put them to that
directory.

OpenStack maintains the contents of this directory and its size should not
increase during normal operation. However, in case of power failures or
accidental shutdowns, some files might be left over.  To prevent these files
from filling up dom0's filesystem, set up this directory as a symlink that
points to a subdirectory of the local SR.

Run these commands in dom0 to achieve this setup:

.. code-block:: console

   # LOCAL_SR=$(xe sr-list name-label="Local storage" --minimal)
   # LOCALPATH="/var/run/sr-mount/$LOCAL_SR/os-guest-kernels"
   # mkdir -p "$LOCALPATH"
   # ln -s "$LOCALPATH" /boot/guest

Modify dom0 for resize/migration support
----------------------------------------

To resize servers with XenServer you must:

* Establish a root trust between all hypervisor nodes of your deployment:

  To do so, generate an ssh key-pair with the :command:`ssh-keygen` command.
  Ensure that each of your dom0's ``authorized_keys`` file (located in
  ``/root/.ssh/authorized_keys``) contains the public key fingerprint (located
  in ``/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``).

* Provide a ``/images`` mount point to the dom0 for your hypervisor:

  dom0 space is at a premium so creating a directory in dom0 is potentially
  dangerous and likely to fail especially when you resize large servers.  The
  least you can do is to symlink ``/images`` to your local storage SR.  The
  following instructions work for an English-based installation of XenServer
  and in the case of ext3-based SR (with which the resize functionality is
  known to work correctly).

  .. code-block:: console

     # LOCAL_SR=$(xe sr-list name-label="Local storage" --minimal)
     # IMG_DIR="/var/run/sr-mount/$LOCAL_SR/images"
     # mkdir -p "$IMG_DIR"
     # ln -s "$IMG_DIR" /images

XenAPI configuration reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following section discusses some commonly changed options when using the
XenAPI driver. The table below provides a complete reference of all
configuration options available for configuring XAPI with OpenStack.

The recommended way to use XAPI with OpenStack is through the XenAPI driver.
To enable the XenAPI driver, add the following configuration options to
``/etc/nova/nova.conf`` and restart ``OpenStack Compute``:

.. code-block:: ini

   compute_driver = xenapi.XenAPIDriver
   [xenserver]
   connection_url = http://your_xenapi_management_ip_address
   connection_username = root
   connection_password = your_password
   ovs_integration_bridge = br-int
   vif_driver = nova.virt.xenapi.vif.XenAPIOpenVswitchDriver

These connection details are used by OpenStack Compute service to contact your
hypervisor and are the same details you use to connect XenCenter, the XenServer
management console, to your XenServer node.

.. note::

   The ``connection_url`` is generally the management network IP
   address of the XenServer.

Networking configuration
------------------------

The Networking service in the Compute node is running
``neutron-openvswitch-agent``, this manages dom0's OVS. You can refer
Networking `openvswitch_agent.ini.sample <https://github.com/openstack/
openstack-manuals/blob/master/doc/config-reference/source/samples/neutron/
openvswitch_agent.ini.sample>`_ for details, however there are several specific
items to look out for.

.. code-block:: ini

   [agent]
   minimize_polling = False
   root_helper_daemon = xenapi_root_helper

   [ovs]
   of_listen_address = management_ip_address
   ovsdb_connection = tcp:your_xenapi_management_ip_address:6640
   bridge_mappings = <physical_network>:<physical_bridge>, ...
   integration_bridge = br-int

   [xenapi]
   connection_url = http://your_xenapi_management_ip_address
   connection_username = root
   connection_password = your_pass_word

.. note::

   The ``ovsdb_connection`` is the connection string for the native OVSDB
   backend, you need to enable port 6640 in dom0.

Agent
-----

The agent is a piece of software that runs on the instances, and communicates
with OpenStack. In case of the XenAPI driver, the agent communicates with
OpenStack through XenStore (see `the Xen Project Wiki
<http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/XenStore>`_ for more information on XenStore).

If you don't have the guest agent on your VMs, it takes a long time for
OpenStack Compute to detect that the VM has successfully started.  Generally a
large timeout is required for Windows instances, but you may want to adjust:
``agent_version_timeout`` within the ``[xenserver]`` section.

VNC proxy address
-----------------

Assuming you are talking to XAPI through a management network, and XenServer is
on the address: 10.10.1.34 specify the same address for the vnc proxy address:
``vncserver_proxyclient_address=10.10.1.34``

Storage
-------

You can specify which Storage Repository to use with nova by editing the
following flag. To use the local-storage setup by the default installer:

.. code-block:: ini

   sr_matching_filter = "other-config:i18n-key=local-storage"

Another alternative is to use the "default" storage (for example if you have
attached NFS or any other shared storage):

.. code-block:: ini

   sr_matching_filter = "default-sr:true"

Image upload in TGZ compressed format
-------------------------------------

To start uploading ``tgz`` compressed raw disk images to the Image service,
configure ``xenapi_image_upload_handler`` by replacing ``GlanceStore`` with
``VdiThroughDevStore``.

.. code-block:: ini

   xenapi_image_upload_handler=nova.virt.xenapi.image.vdi_through_dev.VdiThroughDevStore

As opposed to:

.. code-block:: ini

   xenapi_image_upload_handler=nova.virt.xenapi.image.glance.GlanceStore
