===================================
Configure SSH between compute nodes
===================================

.. todo::

    Consider merging this into a larger "live-migration" document or to the
    installation guide

If you are resizing or migrating an instance between hypervisors, you might
encounter an SSH (Permission denied) error. Ensure that each node is configured
with SSH key authentication so that the Compute service can use SSH to move
disks to other nodes.

To share a key pair between compute nodes, complete the following steps:

#. On the first node, obtain a key pair (public key and private key). Use the
   root key that is in the ``/root/.ssh/id_rsa`` and ``/root/.ssh/id_ras.pub``
   directories or generate a new key pair.

#. Run :command:`setenforce 0` to put SELinux into permissive mode.

#. Enable login abilities for the nova user:

   .. code-block:: console

      # usermod -s /bin/bash nova

   Switch to the nova account.

   .. code-block:: console

      # su nova

#. As root, create the folder that is needed by SSH and place the private key
   that you obtained in step 1 into this folder:

   .. code-block:: console

      mkdir -p /var/lib/nova/.ssh
      cp <private key>  /var/lib/nova/.ssh/id_rsa
      echo 'StrictHostKeyChecking no' >> /var/lib/nova/.ssh/config
      chmod 600 /var/lib/nova/.ssh/id_rsa /var/lib/nova/.ssh/authorized_keys

#. Repeat steps 2-4 on each node.

   .. note::

      The nodes must share the same key pair, so do not generate a new key pair
      for any subsequent nodes.

#. From the first node, where you created the SSH key, run:

   .. code-block:: console

      ssh-copy-id -i <pub key> nova@remote-host

   This command installs your public key in a remote machine's
   ``authorized_keys`` folder.

#. Ensure that the nova user can now log in to each node without using a
   password:

   .. code-block:: console

      # su nova
      $ ssh *computeNodeAddress*
      $ exit

#. As root on each node, restart both libvirt and the Compute services:

   .. code-block:: console

      # systemctl restart libvirtd.service
      # systemctl restart openstack-nova-compute.service
