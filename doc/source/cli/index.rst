Command-line Utilities
======================

In this section you will find information on Nova's command line utilities.

Nova Management Commands
------------------------

These commands are used to manage existing installations. They are designed to
be run by operators in an environment where they have direct access to the nova
database.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   nova-manage
   nova-status

Service Daemons
---------------

The service daemons make up a functioning nova environment. All of these are
expected to be started by an init system, expect to read a nova.conf file, and
daemonize correctly after starting up.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   nova-api
   nova-compute
   nova-conductor
   nova-console
   nova-consoleauth
   nova-novncproxy
   nova-scheduler
   nova-serialproxy
   nova-spicehtml5proxy
   nova-xvpvncproxy

WSGI Services
-------------

Starting in the Pike release, the prefered way to deploy the nova api is in a
wsgi container (uwsgi or apache/mod_wsgi). These are the wsgi entry points to
do that.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   nova-api-metadata
   nova-api-os-compute

Additional Tools
----------------

There are a few additional cli tools which nova services call when
appropriate. This should not need to be called directly by operators, but they
are documented for completeness and debugging if something goes wrong.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   nova-rootwrap
   nova-idmapshift

Deprecated Services
-------------------

The following services are deprecated in nova. They should not be used in new
deployments, but are documented for existing ones.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   nova-cells
   nova-dhcpbridge
   nova-network
