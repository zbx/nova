================================
 Technical Reference Deep Dives
================================

The nova project is large, and there are lots of complicated parts in it where
it helps to have an overview to understand how the internals of a particular
part work.

Internals
=========

The following is a dive into some of the internals in nova.

* :doc:`/reference/rpc`: How nova uses AMQP as an RPC transport
* :doc:`/reference/services`: Module descriptions for some of the key modules
  used in starting / running services
* :doc:`/reference/vm-states`: Cheat sheet for understanding the life cycle of
  compute instances
* :doc:`/reference/threading`: The concurrency model used in nova, which is
  based on eventlet, and may not be familiar to everyone.
* :doc:`/reference/notifications`: How the notifications subsystem works in
  nova, and considerations when adding notifications.

Debugging
=========

* :doc:`/reference/gmr`: Inspired by Amiga, a way to trigger a very
  comprehensive dump of a running service for deep debugging.

Forward Looking Plans
=====================

The following section includes documents that describe the overall plan behind
groups of nova-specs. Most of these cover items relating to the evolution of
various parts of nova's architecture. Once the work is complete,
these documents will move into the "Internals" section.

If you want to get involved in shaping the future of nova's architecture,
these are a great place to start reading up on the current plans.

* :doc:`/user/cells`: Comparison of Cells v1 and v2, and how v2 is evolving
* :doc:`/reference/policy-enforcement`: How we want policy checks on API actions
  to work in the future
* :doc:`/reference/stable-api`: What stable api means to nova
* :doc:`/reference/scheduler-evolution`: Motivation behind the scheduler /
  placement evolution
