    Enables NUMA topology reporting on PowerPC architecture
    from the libvirt driver in Nova but with a caveat as mentioned below.
    NUMA cell affinity and dedicated cpu pinning
    code assumes that the host operating system is exposed to threads.
    PowerPC based hosts use core based scheduling for processes.
    Due to this, the cores on the PowerPC architecture are treated as
    threads. Since cores are always less than or equal
    to the threads on a system, this leads to non-optimal resource usage
    while pinning. This feature is supported from libvirt version 1.2.19
    for PowerPC.
