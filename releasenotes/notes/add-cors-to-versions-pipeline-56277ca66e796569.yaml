upgrade:
  - To allow access to the versions REST API from diverse origins,
    CORS support has been added to the 'oscomputeversions' pipeline
    in '/etc/nova/api-paste.ini'. Existing deployments that wish to
    enable support should add the 'cors' filter at the start of the
    'oscomputeversions' pipeline.
