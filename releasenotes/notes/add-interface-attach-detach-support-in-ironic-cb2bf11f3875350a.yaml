features:
  - |
    Adds interface attach/detach support to baremetal nodes using ironic virt
    driver. Note that the instance info cache update relies on getting a
    ``network-changed`` event from neutron, or on the periodic task healing
    the instance info cache, both of which are asynchronous. This means that
    nova's cached network information (which is what is sent e.g. in the
    ``GET /servers`` responses) may not be up to date immediately after the
    attachment or detachment.
upgrade:
  - |
    Interface attachment/detachment for ironic virt driver was implemented in
    in-tree network interfaces in ironic version 8.0, and this release is
    required for nova's interface attachment feature to work. Prior to that
    release, calling VIF attach on an active ironic node using in-tree network
    interfaces would be basically a noop. It should not be an issue during the
    upgrade though, as it is required to upgrade ironic before nova.
