    The fields ``locked`` and ``display_description`` have been added to
    InstancePayload. Versioned notifications for instance actions
    will include these fields.

    A few examples of versioned notifications that use InstancePayload:

    * ``instance.create``
    * ``instance.delete``
    * ``instance.resize``
    * ``instance.pause``
