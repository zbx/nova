features:
  - OSProfiler support was added. This cross-project profiling library
    allows to trace various OpenStack requests through all OpenStack
    services that support it. To initiate OpenStack
    request tracing `--profile <HMAC_KEY>` option needs to be added to
    the CLI command. This key needs to present one of the secret keys
    defined in nova.conf configuration file with `hmac_keys` option
    under the `[profiler]` configuration section. To enable or disable
    Nova profiling the appropriate `enabled` option under the same
    section needs to be set either to `True` or `False`. By default
    Nova will trace all API and RPC requests, but there is an opportunity
    to trace DB requests as well. For this purpose `trace_sqlalchemy`
    option needs to be set to `True`. As a prerequisite OSProfiler
    library and its storage backend needs to be installed to the
    environment. If so (and if profiling is enabled in nova.conf)
    the trace can be generated via following command, for instance -
    `$ nova --profile SECRET_KEY boot --image <image> --flavor <flavor> <name>`.
    At the end of output there will be message with <trace_id>, and
    to plot nice HTML graphs the following command should be used -
    `$ osprofiler trace show <trace_id> --html --out result.html`
security:
  - OSProfiler support requires passing of trace information
    between various OpenStack services. This information is
    securely signed by one of HMAC keys, defined in nova.conf configuration
    file. To allow cross-project tracing user should use the key, that is
    common among all OpenStack services he or she wants to trace.
