    In the 2.50 microversion, the following fields are added to the
    ``GET /os-quota-class-sets`` and ``PUT /os-quota-class-sets/{id}`` API
    response:

    - ``server_groups``
    - ``server_group_members``

    And the following fields are removed from the same APIs in the same
    microversion:

    - ``fixed_ips``
    - ``floating_ips``
    - ``security_groups``
    - ``security_group_rules``
    - ``networks``
