features:
  - |
    The network.json metadata format has been amended for IPv6 networks
    under Neutron control. The type that is shown has been changed
    from being always set to ``ipv6_dhcp`` to correctly reflecting the
    ``ipv6_address_mode`` option in Neutron, so the type now will be
    ``ipv6_slaac``, ``ipv6_dhcpv6-stateless`` or ``ipv6_dhcpv6-stateful``.
