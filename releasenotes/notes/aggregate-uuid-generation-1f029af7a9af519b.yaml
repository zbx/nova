upgrade:
  - Upon first startup of the scheduler service in Mitaka, all defined
    aggregates will have UUIDs generated and saved back to the
    database. If you have a significant number of aggregates, this may
    delay scheduler start as that work is completed, but it should be
    minor for most deployments.
