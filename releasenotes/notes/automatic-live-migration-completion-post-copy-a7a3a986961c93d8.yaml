  - New configuration option live_migration_permit_post_copy
    has been added to start live migrations in a way that allows
    nova to switch an on-going live migration to post-copy mode.
    Requires libvirt>=1.3.3 and QEMU>=2.5.0. If post copy is
    permitted and version requirements are met it also changes
    behaviour of 'live_migration_force_complete', so that it
    switches on-going live migration to post-copy mode instead
    of pausing an instance during live migration.
