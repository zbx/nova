features:
  - Support versioned notifications for flavor operations like create, delete,
    update access and update extra_specs.
issues:
  - |
    Flavor.projects (access) will not be present in the instance versioned
    notifications since notifications currently do not lazy-load fields. This
    limitation is being tracked with `bug 1653221`_.
