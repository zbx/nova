    A new host_status attribute for servers/detail and servers/{server_id}.
    In order to use this new feature, user have to contain the header of
    request microversion v2.16 in the API request. A new policy
    ``os_compute_api:servers:show:host_status`` added to enable the feature.
    By default, this is only exposed to cloud administrators.
