    Hyper-V RemoteFX feature.

    Microsoft RemoteFX enhances the visual experience in RDP connections,
    including providing access to virtualized instances of a physical GPU to
    multiple guests running on Hyper-V.

    In order to use RemoteFX in Hyper-V 2012 R2, one or more DirectX 11
    capable display adapters must be present and the RDS-Virtualization
    server feature must be installed.

    To enable this feature, the following config option must be set in
    the Hyper-V compute node's 'nova.conf' file::

        [hyperv]
        enable_remotefx = True

    To create instances with RemoteFX capabilities, the following flavor
    extra specs must be used:

    **os:resolution**. Guest VM screen resolution size. Acceptable values::

        1024x768, 1280x1024, 1600x1200, 1920x1200, 2560x1600, 3840x2160

    '3840x2160' is only available on Windows / Hyper-V Server 2016.

    **os:monitors**. Guest VM number of monitors. Acceptable values::

        [1, 4] - Windows / Hyper-V Server 2012 R2
        [1, 8] - Windows / Hyper-V Server 2016

    **os:vram**. Guest VM VRAM amount. Only available on
    Windows / Hyper-V Server 2016. Acceptable values::

        64, 128, 256, 512, 1024

    There are a few considerations that needs to be kept in mind:

    * Not all guests support RemoteFX capabilities.
    * Windows / Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 does not support Generation 2 VMs
      with RemoteFX capabilities.
    * Per resolution, there is a maximum amount of monitors that can be
      added. The limits are as follows:

      For Windows / Hyper-V Server 2012 R2::

          1024x768: 4
          1280x1024: 4
          1600x1200: 3
          1920x1200: 2
          2560x1600: 1

      For Windows / Hyper-V Server 2016::

          1024x768: 8
          1280x1024: 8
          1600x1200: 4
          1920x1200: 4
          2560x1600: 2
          3840x2160: 1
