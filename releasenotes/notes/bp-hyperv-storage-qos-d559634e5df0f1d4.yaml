    The Hyper-V driver now supports the following quota flavor extra
    specs, allowing to specify IO limits applied for each of the
    instance local disks, individually.

    - quota:disk_total_bytes_sec
    - quota:disk_total_iops_sec - those are normalized IOPS, thus each
      IO request is accounted for as 1 normalized IO if the size of the
      request is less than or equal to a predefined base size (8KB).

    Also, the following Cinder front-end QoS specs are now supported
    for SMB Cinder backends:

    - total_bytes_sec
    - total_iops_sec - normalized IOPS
