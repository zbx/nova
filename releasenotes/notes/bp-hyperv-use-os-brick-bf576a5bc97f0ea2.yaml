    The Hyper-V driver now uses os-brick for volume related
    operations, introducing the following new features:

    - Attaching volumes over fibre channel on a passthrough
      basis.
    - Improved iSCSI MPIO support, by connecting to multiple
      iSCSI targets/portals when available and allowing using
      a predefined list of initiator HBAs.
