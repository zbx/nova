feature:
  - Make block_migration to support 'auto' value, which means nova will decide
    the value of block_migration during live-migration, and remove
    disk_over_commit flag for os-migrateLive action in microversion 2.23.
upgrade:
  - We can not use microversion 2.25 to do live-migration during upgrade,
    nova-api will raise bad request if there is still old compute node in the
    cluster.
