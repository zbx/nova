    A new option "live_migration_inbound_addr" has been added
    in the configuration file, set None as default value.
    If this option is present in pre_migration_data, the ip
    address/hostname provided will be used instead of
    the migration target compute node's hostname as the
    uri for live migration, if it's None, then the
    mechanism remains as it is before.
