features:
  - Added support for CPU thread policies, which can be used to control how
    the libvirt virt driver places guests with respect to CPU SMT "threads".
    These are provided as instance and image metadata options,
    'hw:cpu_thread_policy' and 'hw_cpu_thread_policy' respectively, and
    provide an additional level of control over CPU pinning policy, when
    compared to the existing CPU policy feature.
    These changes were introduced in commits '83cd67c' and 'aaaba4a'.
