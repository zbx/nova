upgrade:
  - The three configuration options ``cpu_allocation_ratio``,
    ``ram_allocation_ratio`` and ``disk_allocation_ratio`` for
    the nova compute are now checked against negative values.
    If any of these three options is set to negative value
    then nova compute service will fail to start.
