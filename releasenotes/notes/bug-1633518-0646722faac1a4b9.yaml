fixes:
  - Prior to Newton, volumes encrypted by the CryptsetupEncryptor and
    LuksEncryptor encryption providers used a mangled passphrase stripped of
    leading zeros per hexadecimal. When opening encrypted volumes,
    LuksEncryptor now attempts to replace these mangled passphrases if detected
    while CryptsetupEncryptor simply uses the mangled passphrase.
