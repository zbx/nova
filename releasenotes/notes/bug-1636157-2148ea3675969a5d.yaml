     The same policy rule (os_compute_api:os-server-groups)
     was being used for all actions (show, index, delete, create)
     for server_groups REST APIs. It was thus impossible to provide
     different RBAC for specific actions based on roles. To address
     this changes were made to have separate policy rules for each
     action. The original rule (os_compute_api:os-server-groups) is
     left unchanged for backward compatibility.
