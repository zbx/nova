     ``instance.shutdown.end`` versioned notification will
     have an empty ``ip_addresses`` field since the network
     resources associated with the instance are deallocated
     before this notification is sent, which is actually
     more accurate. Consumers should rely on the
     instance.shutdown.start notification if they need the
     network information for the instance when it is being
     deleted.
