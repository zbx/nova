    The ``PUT /os-services/disable``, ``PUT /os-services/enable`` and
    ``PUT /os-services/force-down`` APIs to enable, disable, or force-down a
    service will now only work with *nova-compute* services. If you are using
    those APIs to try and disable a non-compute service, like nova-scheduler or
    nova-conductor, those APIs will result in a 404 response.

    There really never was a good reason to disable or enable non-compute
    services anyway since that would not do anything. The nova-scheduler and
    nova-api services are checking the ``status`` and ``forced_down`` fields to
    see if instance builds can be scheduled to a compute host or if instances
    can be evacuated from a downed compute host. There is nothing that relies
    on a disabled or downed nova-conductor or nova-scheduler service.
