    Due to `bug 1707256`_, shared storage modeling in Placement is not
    supported by the scheduler. This means that in the Pike release series,
    an operator will be unable to model a shared storage pool between two or
    more compute hosts using the Placement service for scheduling and resource
    tracking.

    This is not a regression, just a note about functionality that is not yet
    available. Support for modeling shared storage providers will be worked on
    in the Queens release.
