    The os-volume_attachments APIs no longer check
    ``os_compute_api:os-volumes`` policy. They do still check
    ``os_compute_api:os-volumes-attachments`` policy rules. Deployers
    who have customized policy should confirm that their settings for
    os-volume_attachments policy checks are sufficient.
