features:
  - On live-migrate actions, the default behaviour when providing a host in
    the request body changed. Now, instead of bypassing the scheduler when
    asking for a destination, it will instead call it with the requested
    destination to make sure the proposed host is accepted by all the filters
    and the original request.
    In case the administrator doesn't want to call the scheduler when providing
    a destination, a new request body field called ``force`` (defaulted to
    False) will modify that new behaviour by forcing the live-migrate operation
    to the destination without verifying the scheduler.
