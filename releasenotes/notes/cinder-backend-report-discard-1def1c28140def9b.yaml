features:
  - Add support for enabling discard support for block devices with libvirt.
    This will be enabled for Cinder volume attachments that specify support
    for the feature in their connection properties. This requires support to
    be present in the version of libvirt (v1.0.6+) and qemu (v1.6.0+) used
    along with the configured virtual drivers for the instance. The
    virtio-blk driver does not support this functionality.
