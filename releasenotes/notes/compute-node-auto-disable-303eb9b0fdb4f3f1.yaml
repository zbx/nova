    The `nova-compute` worker can automatically disable itself in the
    service database if consecutive build failures exceed a set threshold. The
    ``[compute]/consecutive_build_service_disable_threshold`` configuration option
    allows setting the threshold for this behavior, or disabling it entirely if
    desired.
    The intent is that an admin will examine the issue before manually
    re-enabling the service, which will avoid that compute node becoming a
    black hole build magnet.
upgrade:
  - |
    The new configuration option
    ``[compute]/consecutive_build_service_disable_threshold``
    defaults to a nonzero value, which means multiple failed builds will
    result in a compute node auto-disabling itself.
