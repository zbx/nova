    A new ``auto`` value for the configuration option
    ``upgrade_levels.compute`` is accepted, that allows automatic determination
    of the compute service version to use for RPC communication. By default, we
    still use the newest version if not set in the config, a specific version
    if asked, and only do this automatic behavior if 'auto' is
    configured. When 'auto' is used, sending a SIGHUP to the service
    will cause the value to be re-calculated. Thus, after an upgrade
    is complete, sending SIGHUP to all services will cause them to
    start sending messages compliant with the newer RPC version.
