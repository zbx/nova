    TypeAffinityFilter is deprecated for removal in the
    17.0.0 Queens release. There is no replacement planned for this
    filter. It is fundamentally flawed in that it relies on the
    ``flavors.id`` primary key and if a flavor "changed", i.e. deleted
    and re-created with new values, it will result in this filter
    thinking it is a different flavor, thus breaking the usefulness of
    this filter.
