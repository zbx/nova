deprecations:
  - |
    The ``console_driver`` config opt in the ``DEFAULT`` group has been
    deprecated and will be removed in a future release. This option no longer
    does anything. Previously this option had only two valid, in-tree values:
    ``nova.console.xvp.XVPConsoleProxy`` and
    ``nova.console.fake.FakeConsoleProxy``. The latter of these was only used
    in tests and has since been replaced.
