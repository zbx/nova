issues:
  - |
    The live-migration progress timeout controlled by the configuration option
    ``[libvirt]/live_migration_progress_timeout`` has been discovered to
    frequently cause live-migrations to fail with a progress timeout error,
    even though the live-migration is still making good progress.
    To minimize problems caused by these checks we have changed the default
    to 0, which means do not trigger a timeout.
    To modify when a live-migration will fail with a timeout error, please now
    look at ``[libvirt]/live_migration_completion_timeout`` and
    ``[libvirt]/live_migration_downtime``.
deprecations:
  - |
    ``[libvirt]/live_migration_progress_timeout`` has been deprecated as this
    feature has been found not to work. See bug 1644248 for more details.
