    When using neutron polling mode with XenAPI driver, booting a VM will
    timeout because ``nova-compute`` cannot receive network-vif-plugged event.
    This is because it set vif['id'](i.e. neutron port uuid) to two different
    OVS ports. One is XenServer VIF, the other is tap device qvo-XXXX, but
    setting 'nicira-iface-id' to XenServer VIF isn't correct, so deprecate it.
