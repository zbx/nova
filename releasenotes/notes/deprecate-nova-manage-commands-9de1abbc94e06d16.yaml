upgrade:
  - |
    The ``nova-manage project quota_usage_refresh`` and its alias ``nova-manage
    account quota_usage_refresh`` commands have been renamed ``nova-manage
    quota refresh``. Aliases are provided but these are marked as deprecated
    and will be removed in the next release of nova.
deprecations:
  - |
    A number of `nova-manage` commands have been deprecated. The commands,
    along with the reasons for their deprecation, are listed below:

    `account`

      This allows for the creation, deletion, update and listing of user and
      project quotas. Operators should use the equivalent resources in the
      `REST API`__ instead.

      The ``quota_usage_refresh`` sub-command has been renamed to ``nova-manage
      quota refresh``. This new command should be used instead.

    `agent`

      This allows for the creation, deletion, update and listing of "agent
      builds". Operators should use the equivalent resources in the `REST
      API`__ instead.

    `host`

      This allows for the listing of compute hosts. Operators should use the
      equivalent resources in the `REST API`__ instead.

    `log`

      This allows for the filtering of errors from nova's logs and extraction
      of all logs from syslog. This command has not been actively maintained in
      a long time, is not tested, and can be achieved using `journalctl` or by
      simply grepping through ``/var/log``. It will simply be removed.

    `project`

      This is an alias for `account` and has been deprecated for the same
      reasons.

    `shell`

      This starts the Python interactive interpreter. It is a clone of the same
      functionality found in Django's `django-manage` command. This command
      hasn't been actively maintained in a long time and is not tested. It will
      simply be removed.

    These commands will be removed in their entirety during the Queens cycle.
