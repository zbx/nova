deprecations:
  - Deprecate the VMware driver's ``wsdl_location`` config option. This
    option pointed to the location of the WSDL files required when using
    vCenter versions earlier than 5.1. Since the minimum supported version
    of vCenter is 5.1, there is no longer a need for this option and its
    value is ignored.
