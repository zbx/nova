upgrade:
  - |
    The default value for the ``[xenserver]/vif_driver`` configuration option
    has been changed to ``nova.virt.xenapi.vif.XenAPIOpenVswitchDriver`` to
    match the default configuration of ``[DEFAULT]/use_neutron=True``.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``[xenserver]/vif_driver`` configuration option is deprecated for
    removal. The ``XenAPIOpenVswitchDriver`` vif driver is used for Neutron and
    the ``XenAPIBridgeDriver`` vif driver is used for nova-network, which
    itself is deprecated. In the future, the ``use_neutron`` configuration
    option will be used to determine which vif driver to load.
