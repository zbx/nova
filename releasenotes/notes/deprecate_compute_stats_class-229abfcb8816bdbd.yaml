deprecations:

  - Deprecate ``compute_stats_class`` config option. This allowed
    loading an alternate implementation for collecting statistics for
    the local compute host. Deployments that felt the need to use
    this facility are encouraged to propose additions upstream so we
    can create a stable and supported interface here.
