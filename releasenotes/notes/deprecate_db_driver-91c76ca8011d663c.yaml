deprecations:

  - Deprecate the ``db_driver`` config option. Previously this let you
    replace our SQLAlchemy database layer with your own. This approach
    is deprecated. Deployments that felt the need to use the facility
    are encourage to work with upstream Nova to address db driver
    concerns in the main SQLAlchemy code paths.
