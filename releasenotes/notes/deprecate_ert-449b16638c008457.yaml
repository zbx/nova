    The Extensible Resource Tracker is deprecated and will be removed in the
    14.0.0 release.
    If you use this functionality and have custom resources that are managed
    by the Extensible Resource Tracker, please contact the Nova development
    team by posting to the openstack-dev mailing list.
    There is no future planned support for the tracking of custom resources.
