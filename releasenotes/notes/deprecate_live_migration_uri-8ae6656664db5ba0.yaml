deprecations:
  - |
    The ``live_migration_uri`` option in the [libvirt] configuration section
    is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. The
    ``live_migration_scheme`` should be used to change scheme used for live
    migration, and ``live_migration_inbound_addr`` should be used to change
    target URI.
features:
  - |
    The libvirt driver now has a ``live_migration_scheme`` configuration
    option which should be used where the ``live_migration_uri`` would
    previously have been configured with non-default scheme.
