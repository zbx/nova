deprecations:

  - Nova network is now deprecated. Based on the results of the
    current OpenStack User Survey less than 10% of our users remain on
    Nova network. This is the signal that it is time migrate to
    Neutron. No new features will be added to Nova network, and bugs
    will only be fixed on a case by case basis.
