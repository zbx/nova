    Nova used to support the concept that ``service managers`` were
    replaceable components. There are many config options where you can
    replace a manager by specifying a new class. This concept is
    deprecated in Mitaka as are the following config options.

      * [cells] manager
      * metadata_manager
      * compute_manager
      * console_manager
      * consoleauth_manager
      * cert_manager
      * scheduler_manager

    Many of these will be removed in Newton. Users of these options
    are encouraged to work with Nova upstream on any features missing
    in the default implementations that are needed.
