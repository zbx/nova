deprecations:

  - Deprecate the ``vendordata_driver`` config option. This allowed
    creating a different class loader for defining vendordata
    metadata. The default driver loads from a json file that can be
    arbitrarily specified, so is still quite flexible. Deployments that
    felt the need to use this facility are encouraged to propose
    additions upstream so we can create a stable and supported
    interface here.
