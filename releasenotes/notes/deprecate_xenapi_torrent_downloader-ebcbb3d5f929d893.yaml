    The XenServer driver provides support for downloading images via torrents.
    This feature has not been tested, and it's not clear whether there's a
    clear use case for such a feature. As a result, this feature is now
    deprecated as are the following config options.

    * ``torrent_base_url``
    * ``torrent_seed_chance``
    * ``torrent_seed_duration``
    * ``torrent_max_last_accessed``
    * ``torrent_listen_port_start``
    * ``torrent_listen_port_end``
    * ``torrent_download_stall_cutoff``
    * ``torrent_max_seeder_processes_per_host``
