deprecations:
  - |
    The following APIs which are considered as proxies of Neutron networking
    API, are deprecated and will result in a 404 error response in microversion
    `2.44`::

         POST /servers/{server_uuid}/action
         {
             "addFixedIp": {...}
         }
         POST /servers/{server_uuid}/action
         {
             "removeFixedIp": {...}
         }
         POST /servers/{server_uuid}/action
         {
             "addFloatingIp": {...}
         }
         POST /servers/{server_uuid}/action
         {
             "removeFloatingIp": {...}
         }

    Those server actions can be replaced by calling the Neutron API directly.

    The nova-network specific API to query the server's interfaces is
    deprecated::

         GET /servers/{server_uuid}/os-virtual-interfaces

    To query attached neutron interfaces for a specific server, the API
    `GET /servers/{server_uuid}/os-interface` can be used.
