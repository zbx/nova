features:
  - A disk space scheduling filter is now available,
    which prefers compute nodes with the most available
    disk space.  By default, free disk space is given equal
    importance to available RAM.  To increase the priority
    of free disk space in scheduling, increase the
    disk_weight_multiplier option.
