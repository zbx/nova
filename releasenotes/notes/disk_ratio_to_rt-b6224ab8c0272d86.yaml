feature:
  - On Mitaka compute nodes, if you want to modify the default disk allocation
    ratio of 1.0, you should set that on every compute node, rather than
    setting it in the scheduler. This means the disk, RAM and CPU allocation
    ratios now all work in the same way.
upgrade:
  - For Liberty compute nodes, the disk_allocation_ratio works as before, you
    must set it on the scheduler if you want to change it.
    For Mitaka compute nodes, the disk_allocation_ratio set on the compute
    nodes will be used only if the configuration is not set on the scheduler.
    This is to allow, for backwards compatibility, the ability to still
    override the disk allocation ratio by setting the configuration on the
    scheduler node.
    In Newton, we plan to remove the ability to set the disk allocation ratio
    on the scheduler, at which point the compute nodes will always define the
    disk allocation ratio, and pass that up to the scheduler. None of this
    changes the default disk allocation ratio of 1.0. This matches the
    behaviour of the RAM and CPU allocation ratios.
