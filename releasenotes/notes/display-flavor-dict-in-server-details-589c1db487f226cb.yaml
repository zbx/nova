  - A new 2.47 microversion was added to the Compute API.  Users specifying
    this microversion or later will see the "flavor" information displayed as
    a dict when displaying server details via the `servers` REST API endpoint.
    If the user is prevented by policy from indexing extra-specs, then the
    "extra_specs" field will not be included in the flavor information.
