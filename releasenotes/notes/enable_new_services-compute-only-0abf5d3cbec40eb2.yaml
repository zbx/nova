    The ``[DEFAULT]/enable_new_services`` configuration option will now only be
    used to auto-disable new nova-compute services. Other services like
    nova-conductor, nova-scheduler and nova-osapi_compute will not be
    auto-disabled since disabling them does nothing functionally, and starting
    in Pike the ``PUT /os-services/enable`` REST API will not be able to find
    non-compute services to enable them.
