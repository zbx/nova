    The following policy enforcement points have been removed as part
    of the restructuring of the Nova API code. The attributes that
    could have been hidden with these policy points will now always be
    shown / accepted.

     * os_compute_api:os-disk-config - show / accept
       ``OS-DCF:diskConfig`` parameter on servers

     * os-access-ips - show / accept ``accessIPv4`` and ``accessIPv6``
       parameters on servers

    The following entry points have been removed

     * nova.api.v21.extensions.server.resize - allowed accepting
       additional parameters on server resize requests.

     * nova.api.v21.extensions.server.update - allowed accepting
       additional parameters on server update requests.

     * nova.api.v21.extensions.server.rebuild - allowed accepting
       additional parameters on server rebuild requests.
