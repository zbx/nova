    Filters internal interface changed using now the RequestSpec NovaObject
    instead of an old filter_properties dictionary.
    In case you run out-of-tree filters, you need to modify the host_passes()
    method to accept a new RequestSpec object and modify the filter internals
    to use that new object. You can see other in-tree filters for getting the
    logic or ask for help in #openstack-nova IRC channel.
