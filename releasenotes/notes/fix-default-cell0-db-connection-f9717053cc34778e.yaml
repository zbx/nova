    The ``nova-manage cell_v2 simple_cell_setup`` command now creates the
    default cell0 database connection using the ``[database]`` connection
    configuration option rather than the ``[api_database]`` connection. The
    cell0 database schema is the `main` database, i.e. the `instances` table,
    rather than the `api` database schema. In other words, the cell0 database
    would be called something like ``nova_cell0`` rather than
    ``nova_api_cell0``.
