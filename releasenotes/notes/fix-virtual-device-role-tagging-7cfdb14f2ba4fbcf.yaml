    In the context of virtual device role tagging at server create time, the
    2.42 microversion restores the tag attribute to networks and
    block_device_mapping_v2. A bug has caused the tag attribute to no longer be
    accepted starting with version 2.33 for block_device_mapping_v2 and
    starting with version 2.37 for networks. In other words, block devices
    could only be tagged in version 2.32 and network interfaces between
    versions 2.32 and 2.36 inclusively. Starting with 2.42, both network
    interfaces and block devices can be tagged again.
