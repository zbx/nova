    Add granularity to the ``os_compute_api:os-flavor-manage`` policy
    with the addition of distinct actions for create and delete:

    - ``os_compute_api:os-flavor-manage:create``
    - ``os_compute_api:os-flavor-manage:delete``

    To address backwards compatibility, the new rules added to the
    flavor_manage.py policy file, default to the existing rule,
    ``os_compute_api:os-flavor-manage``, if it is set to a non-default
    value.
