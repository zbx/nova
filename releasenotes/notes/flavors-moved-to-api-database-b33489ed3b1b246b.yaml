upgrade:
  - Flavors are being moved to the API database for CellsV2. In this
    release, the online data migrations will move any flavors you have
    in your main database to the API database, retaining all
    attributes. Until this is complete, new attempts to create flavors
    will return an HTTP 409 to avoid creating flavors in one place that
    may conflict with flavors you already have and are yet to be
    migrated.
  - Note that flavors can no longer be soft-deleted as the API
    database does not replicate the legacy soft-delete functionality
    from the main database. As such, deleted flavors are not migrated
    and the behavior users will experience will be the same as if a
    purge of deleted records was performed.
