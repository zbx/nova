features:

  - Nova now defaults to using the glance version 2 protocol for all
    backend operations for all virt drivers. A ``use_glance_v1``
    config option exists to revert to glance version 1 protocol if
    issues are seen, however that will be removed early in Ocata, and
    only glance version 2 protocol will be used going forward.

upgrade:

  - It is now required that the glance environment used by Nova
    exposes the version 2 REST API. This API has been available for
    many years, but previously Nova only used the version 1 API.
