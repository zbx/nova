features:
  - The nova Hyper-V driver can now plug OVS VIFs. This means that
    neutron-ovs-agent can be used as an L2 agent instead of
    neutron-hyperv-agent.
    In order to plug OVS VIFs, the configuration option "vswitch_name"
    from the "hyperv" section must be set to the vSwitch which has the OVS
    extension enabled.
    Hot-plugging is only supported on Windows / Hyper-V Server 2016 + Generation 2 VMs.
    Older Hyper-V versions only support attaching vNICs while the VM is turned off.
