features:
  - The nova Hyper-V driver now supports symmetric NUMA topologies. This means
    that all the NUMA nodes in the NUMA topology must have the same amount of
    vCPUs and memory. It can easily be requested by having the flavor
    extra_spec "hw:numa_nodes", or the image property "hw_numa_nodes".
    An instance with NUMA topology cannot have dynamic memory enabled. Thus,
    if an instance requires a NUMA topology, it will be spawned without
    dynamic memory, regardless of the value set in the "dynamic_memory_ratio"
    config option in the compute node's "nova.conf" file.
    In order to benefit from this feature, the host's NUMA spanning must be
    disabled.
    Hyper-V does not guarantee CPU pinning, thus, the nova Hyper-V driver will
    not spawn instances with the flavor extra_spec "hw:cpu_policy" or image
    property "hw_cpu_policy" set to "dedicated".
