upgrade:
  - Support for Windows / Hyper-V Server 2008 R2 has been deprecated in
    Liberty (12.0.0) and it is no longer supported in Mitaka (13.0.0). If you
    have compute nodes running that version, please consider moving the
    running instances to other compute nodes before upgrading those to Mitaka.
