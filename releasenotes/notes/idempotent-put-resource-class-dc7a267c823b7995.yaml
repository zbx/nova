    The 1.7 version of the placement API changes handling of
    `PUT /resource_classes/{name}` to be a create or verification of the
    resource class with `{name}`. If the resource class is a custom resource
    class and does not already exist it will be created and a ``201`` response
    code returned. If the class already exists the response code will be
    ``204``. This makes it possible to check or create a resource class in one
    request.
