    - The os-instance-actions methods now read actions from deleted instances.
      This means that
      'GET /v2.1/{tenant-id}/servers/{server-id}/os-instance-actions'
      and
      'GET /v2.1/{tenant-id}/servers/{server-id}/os-instance-actions/{req-id}'
      will return instance-action items even if the instance corresponding to
      '{server-id}' has been deleted.
