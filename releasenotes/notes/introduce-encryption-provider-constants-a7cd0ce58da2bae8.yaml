features:

    Encryption provider constants have been introduced detailing the supported
    encryption formats such as LUKs along with their associated in-tree
    provider implementations. These constants should now be used to identify an
    encryption provider implementation for a given encryption format.
deprecations:
  - |
    The direct use of the encryption provider classes such as
    nova.volume.encryptors.luks.LuksEncryptor is now deprecated and will be
    blocked in the Pike release of Nova. The use of out of tree encryption
    provider classes is also deprecated and will be blocked in the Pike release
    of Nova.
