  - Adds serial console support to Ironic driver. Nova now supports
    serial console to Ironic bare metals for Ironic ``socat`` console
    driver.
    In order to use this feature, serial console must be configured in Nova
    and the Ironic ``socat`` console driver must be used and configured
    in Ironic. Ironic serial console configuration is documented in
