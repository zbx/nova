issues:
  - When using Neutron extension 'port_security' and booting an
    instance on a network with 'port_security_enabled=False' the Nova
    API response says there is a 'default' security group attached to
    the instance which is incorrect. However when listing security groups
    for the instance there are none listed, which is correct. The API
    response will be fixed separately with a microversion.
