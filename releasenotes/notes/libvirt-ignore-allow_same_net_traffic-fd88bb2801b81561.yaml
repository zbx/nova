    The libvirt driver port filtering feature will now ignore the
    ``allow_same_net_traffic`` config option.

    The libvirt driver provides port filtering capability. This capability
    is enabled when the following is true:

    - The ``nova.virt.libvirt.firewall.IptablesFirewallDriver`` firewall driver
      is enabled
    - Security groups are disabled
    - Neutron port filtering is disabled/unsupported
    - An IPTables-compatible interface is used, e.g. an OVS VIF in hybrid mode,
      where the VIF is a tap device connected to OVS with a bridge

    When enabled, libvirt applies IPTables rules to all interface ports that
    provide MAC, IP, and ARP spoofing protection.

    Previously, setting the `allow_same_net_traffic` config option to `True`
    allowed for same network traffic when using these port filters. This was
    the default case and was the only case tested. Setting this to `False`
    disabled same network traffic *when using the libvirt driver port filtering
    functionality only*, however, this was neither tested nor documented.

    Given that there are other better documented and better tested ways to
    approach this, such as through use of neutron's native port filtering or
    security groups, this functionality has been removed.  Users should instead
    rely on one of these alternatives.
