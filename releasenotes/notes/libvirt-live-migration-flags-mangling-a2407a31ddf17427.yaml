upgrade:
  - The libvirt driver will now correct unsafe and invalid
    values for the live_migration_flag and block_migration_flag
    configuration options. The live_migration_flag must not
    contain VIR_MIGRATE_SHARED_INC but block_migration_flag
    must contain it. Both options must contain the
    VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER, except when using the 'xen' virt
    type this flag is not supported. Both flags must contain
    the VIR_MIGRATE_UNDEFINE_SOURCE flag and not contain the
    VIR_MIGRATE_PERSIST_DEST flag.
