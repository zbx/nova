  - For the libvirt driver, by default hardware properties will be retrieved
    from the Glance image and if such haven't been provided, it will use
    a libosinfo database to get those values. If users want to force a specific
    guest OS ID for the image, they can now use a new glance image property
    ``os_distro`` (eg. ``--property os_distro=fedora21``). In order to use
    the libosinfo database, you need to separately install the related native
    package provided for your operating system distribution.
