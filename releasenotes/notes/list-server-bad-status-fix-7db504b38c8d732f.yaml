    Fixed bug #1579706: "Listing nova instances with invalid status raises 500
    InternalServerError for admin user". Now passing an invalid status as a
    filter will return an empty list. A subsequent patch will then correct this
    to raise a 400 Bad Request when an invalid status is received.
