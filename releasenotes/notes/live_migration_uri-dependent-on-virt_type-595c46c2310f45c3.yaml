upgrade:
  - The libvirt driver has changed the default value of the
    'live_migration_uri' flag, that now is dependent on the 'virt_type'. The
    old default 'qemu+tcp://%s/system' now is adjusted for each of the
    configured hypervisors. For Xen this will be 'xenmigr://%s/system', for
    kvm/qemu this will be 'qemu+tcp://%s/system'.
