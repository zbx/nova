deprecations:
  - |
    The ``os-hosts`` API is deprecated as of the 2.43 microversion. Requests
    made with microversion >= 2.43 will result in a 404 error. To list and show
    host details, use the ``os-hypervisors`` API. To enable or disable a
    service, use the ``os-services`` API. There is no replacement for the
    `shutdown`, `startup`, `reboot`, or `maintenance_mode` actions as those are
    system-level operations which should be outside of the control of the
    compute service.
