    The 2.45 microversion is introduced which changes the response for the
    ``createImage`` and ``createBackup`` server action APIs to no longer
    return a ``Location`` response header. With microversion 2.45 those APIs
    now return a json dict in the response body with a single ``image_id`` key
    whose value is the snapshot image ID (a uuid). The old ``Location`` header
    in the response before microversion 2.45 is most likely broken and
    inaccessible by end users since it relies on the internal Glance API
    server configuration and does not take into account Glance API versions.
