upgrade:
  - As of Ocata, the minimum version of VMware vCenter that nova compute will
    interoperate with will be 5.1.0. Deployments using older versions of
    vCenter should upgrade. Running with vCenter version less than 5.5.0 is
    also now deprecated and 5.5.0 will become the minimum version in the
    16.0.0 Pike release of Nova.
