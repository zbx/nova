    When instantiating an instance based on an image with the metadata
    hw_vif_multiqueue_enabled=true, if flavor.vcpus is less than the limit
    of the number of queues on a tap interface in the kernel, nova uses
    flavor.vcpus as the number of queues. if not, nova uses the limit.
    The limits are as follows:

      * kernels prior to 3.0: 1
      * kernels 3.x: 8
      * kernels 4.x: 256
