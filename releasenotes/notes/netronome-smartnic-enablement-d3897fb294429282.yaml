features:
  - This release adds support for Netronome's Agilio OVS VIF type. In order
    to use the accelerated plugging modes, external Neutron and OS-VIF plugins
    are required. Consult
    https://github.com/Netronome/agilio-ovs-openstack-plugin for installation
    and operation instructions.
    Consult the Agilio documentation available at
    https://support.netronome.com/ for more information about the plugin
    compatibility and support matrix.
  - The ``virtio-forwarder`` VNIC type has been added to the list of VNICs.
    This VNIC type is intended to request a low-latency virtio port inside the
    instance, likely backed by hardware acceleration. Currently the Agilio OVS
    external Neutron and OS-VIF plugins provide support for this VNIC mode.
