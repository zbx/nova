deprecations:
  - The ``network_device_mtu`` option in Nova is deprecated for removal since
    network MTU should be specified when creating the network with
    nova-network. With Neutron networks, the MTU value comes from the
    ``segment_mtu`` configuration option in Neutron.
other:
  - The Neutron network MTU value is now used when plugging virtual interfaces
    in nova-compute. If the value is 0, which is the default value for the
    ``segment_mtu`` configuration option in Neutron before Mitaka, then the
    (deprecated) ``network_device_mtu`` configuration option in Nova is used,
    which defaults to not setting an MTU value.
