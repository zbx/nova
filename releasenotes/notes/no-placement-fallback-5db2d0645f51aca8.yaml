upgrade:
  - In Ocata, the nova-scheduler would fall back to not calling the
    placement service during instance boot if old computes were
    running. That compatibility mode is no longer present in Pike, and
    as such, the scheduler fully depends on the placement service.
    This effectively means that in Pike Nova requires Placement API
    version 1.4 (Ocata).
