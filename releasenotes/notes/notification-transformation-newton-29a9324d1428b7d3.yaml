    The following legacy notifications have been been transformed to
    a new versioned payload:

    * instance.delete
    * instance.pause
    * instance.power_on
    * instance.shelve
    * instance.suspend
    * instance.restore
    * instance.resize
    * instance.update
    * compute.exception

    Every versioned notification has a sample file stored under
    doc/notification_samples directory. Consult
    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/notifications.html for more information.
