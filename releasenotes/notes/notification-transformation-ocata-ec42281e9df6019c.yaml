    The following legacy notifications have been transformed to
    a new versioned payload:

    * aggregate.create
    * aggregate.delete
    * instance.create
    * instance.finish_resize
    * instance.power_off
    * instance.resume
    * instance.shelve_offload
    * instance.shutdown
    * instance.snapshot
    * instance.unpause
    * instance.unshelve

    Every versioned notification has a sample file stored under
    doc/notification_samples directory. Consult
    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/notifications.html for more information.
