    A new ``nova-status upgrade check`` CLI is provided for checking the
    readiness of a deployment when preparing to upgrade to the latest release.
    The tool is written to handle both fresh installs and upgrades from an
    earlier release, for example upgrading from the 14.0.3 Newton release.
    There can be multiple checks performed with varying degrees of success.
    More details on the command and how to interpret results are in the
    `nova-status man page`_.
