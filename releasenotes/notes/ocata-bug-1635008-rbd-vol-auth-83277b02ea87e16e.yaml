    When making connections to Ceph-backed volumes via the Libvirt driver, the
    auth values (rbd_user, rbd_secret_uuid) are now pulled from the backing
    cinder.conf rather than nova.conf. The nova.conf values are only used if
    set and the cinder.conf values are not set, but this fallback support is
    considered accidental and will be removed in the Nova 16.0.0 Pike release.
    See the Ceph documentation for `configuring Cinder`_ for RBD auth.
