    All deployments will function as a single-cell
    environment. Multiple v2 cells are technically possible, but should
    only be used for testing as many other things will not work across
    cell boundaries yet. For details on cells v2 and the setup required for
    Nova with cells v2, see the cells documentation. [1]_

issues:
  - Once fully upgraded, if you create multiple real cells with hosts, the
    scheduler will utilize them, but those instances will likely be unusable
    because not all API functions are cells-aware yet.
  - Listing instances across multiple cells with a sort order will
    result in barber-pole sorting, striped across the cell boundaries.
