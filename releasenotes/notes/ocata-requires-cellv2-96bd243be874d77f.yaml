upgrade:
  - Ocata requires that your deployment have created the
    cell and host mappings in Newton. If you have not done
    this, Ocata's `db sync` command will fail. Small deployments
    will want to run `nova-manage cell_v2 simple_cell_setup`
    on Newton before upgrading. Operators must create a new database for cell0
    before running `cell_v2 simple_cell_setup`. The simple cell setup command
    expects the name of the cell0 database to be `<main database name>_cell0`
    as it will create a cell mapping for cell0 based on the main database
    connection, sync the cell0 database, and associate existing hosts and
    instances with the single cell.
