    The nova-network service was deprecated in the 14.0.0 Newton release. In
    the 15.0.0 Ocata release, nova-network will only work in a Cells v1
    deployment. The Neutron networking service is now the default configuration
    for new deployments based on the ``use_neutron`` configuration option.
