features:
  - Added a `nova-manage db online_data_migrations` command for forcing online
    data migrations, which
    will run all registered migrations for the release, instead of there being
    a separate command for each logical data migration. Operators need to make
    sure all data is migrated before upgrading to the next release, and the new
    command provides a unified interface for doing it.
