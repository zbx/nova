    Nova now uses oslo.middleware for request_id processing. This
    means that there is now a new ``X-OpenStack-Request-ID`` header
    returned on every request which mirrors the content of the
    existing ``X-Compute-Request-ID``. The expected existence of this
    header is signaled by Microversion 2.46. If server version >= 2.46, you
    can expect to see this header in your results (regardless of
    microversion requested).
