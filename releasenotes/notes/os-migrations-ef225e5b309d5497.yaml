deprecations:
  -
    The old top-level resource `/os-migrations` is deprecated, it won't be
    extended anymore. And migration_type for /os-migrations, also add ref
    link to the /servers/{uuid}/migrations/{id} for it when the migration
    is an in-progress live-migration. This has been added in microversion
    2.23.
