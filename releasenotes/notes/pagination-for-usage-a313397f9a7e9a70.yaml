    Added microversion v2.40 which introduces pagination support for usage
    with the help of new optional parameters 'limit' and 'marker'. If 'limit'
    isn't provided, it will default to the configurable max limit which is
    currently 1000.

    ::

        /os-simple-tenant-usage?limit={limit}&marker={instance_uuid}
        /os-simple-tenant-usage/{tenant}?limit={limit}&marker={instance_uuid}

    Older microversions will not accept these new paging query parameters,
    but they will start to silently limit by the max limit to encourage the
    adoption of this new microversion, and circumvent the existing possibility
    DoS-like usage requests on systems with thousands of instances.
