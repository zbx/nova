    A new 1.10 API microversion is added to the Placement REST API. This
    microversion adds support for the GET /allocation_candidates resource
    endpoint. This endpoint returns information about possible allocation
    requests that callers can make which meet a set of resource constraints
    supplied as query string parameters. Also returned is some inventory and
    capacity information for the resource providers involved in the allocation
    candidates.
