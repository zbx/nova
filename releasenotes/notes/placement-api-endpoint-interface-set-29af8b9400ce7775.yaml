  - The Placement API can be set to connect to a specific
    keystone endpoint interface using the ``os_interface``
    option in the ``[placement]`` section inside ``nova.conf``.

    endpoint interface is desired for connecting to the Placement
    service. By default, keystoneauth will connect to the "public"
    endpoint.
