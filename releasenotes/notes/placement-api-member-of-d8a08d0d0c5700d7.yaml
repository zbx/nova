    A new Placement API microversion 1.3 is added with support for filtering
    the list of resource providers to include only those resource providers
    which are members of any of the aggregates listed by uuid in the `member_of`
    query parameter. The parameter is used when making a
    `GET /resource_providers` request. The value of the parameter uses the
    `in:` syntax to provide a list of aggregate uuids as follows::

        /resource_providers?member_of=in:09c931b0-c0d7-4e80-8e01-9e6511db8259,f8ab4fa2-804f-402e-b675-7918bd04b173

    If other filtering query parameters are present, the results are a boolean
    AND of all the filters.
