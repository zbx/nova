    The filter scheduler will now attempt to claim a number of
    resources in the placement API after determining a list of
    potential hosts. We attempt to claim these resources for each instance
    in the build request, and if a claim does not succeed, we try this
    claim against the next potential host the scheduler selected. This
    claim retry process can potentially attempt claims against a large
    number of hosts, and we do not limit the number of hosts to attempt
    claims against. Claims for resources may fail due to another scheduler
    process concurrently claiming resources against the same compute node.
    This concurrent resource claim is normal and the retry of a claim
    request should be unusual but harmless.
