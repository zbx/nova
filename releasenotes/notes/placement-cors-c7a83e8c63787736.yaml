    The placement API service can now be configured to support
    `CORS <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.middleware/cors.html>`_.
    If a `cors` configuration group is present in the service's configuration
    file (currently `nova.conf`), with `allowed_origin` configured, the values
    within will be used to configure the middleware. If `cors.allowed_origin`
    is not set, the middleware will not be used.
