    A new Placement API microversion 1.4 is added. Users may now query the
    Placement REST API for resource providers that have the ability to meet a
    set of requested resource amounts. The `GET /resource_providers` API call
    can have a "resources" query string parameter supplied that indicates the
    requested amounts of various resources that a provider must have the
    capacity to serve. The "resources" query string parameter takes the form:

    ``?resources=$RESOURCE_CLASS_NAME:$AMOUNT,$RESOURCE_CLASS_NAME:$AMOUNT``

    For instance, if the user wishes to see resource providers that can service
    a request for 2 vCPUs, 1024 MB of RAM and 50 GB of disk space, the user can
    issue a request of::

    ``GET /resource_providers?resources=VCPU:2,MEMORY_MB:1024,DISK_GB:50``

    The placement API is only available to admin users.
