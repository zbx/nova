    A new administrator-only resource endpoint was added to the OpenStack
    Placement REST API for managing custom resource classes. Custom resource
    classes are specific to a deployment and represent types of quantitative
    resources that are not interoperable between OpenStack clouds. See the
    `Placement REST API Version History`_ documentation for usage details.
