    API calls to ``/os-quota-sets`` and flavor access will now attempt
    to validate the project_id being operated on with Keystone. If
    the user token has enough permissions to perform
    ``GET /v3/projects/{project_id}``, and the Keystone project
    does not exist, a 400 BadRequest will be returned to prevent invalid
    project data from being put in the Nova database. This fixes an effective
    silent error where the project_id would be stored even if it was not a
    valid project_id in the system.
