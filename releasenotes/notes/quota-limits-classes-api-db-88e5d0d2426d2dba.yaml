    Quota limits and classes are being moved to the API database for Cells v2.
    In this release, the online data migrations will move any quota limits and
    classes you have in your main database to the API database, retaining all
    attributes.

    .. note:: Quota limits and classes can no longer be soft-deleted as the API
      database does not replicate the legacy soft-delete functionality from the
      main database. As such, deleted quota limits and classes are not migrated
      and the behavior users will experience will be the same as if a purge of
      deleted records was performed.
