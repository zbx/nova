    A new configuration option ``[quota]/recheck_quota`` has been added to
    recheck quota after resource creation to prevent allowing quota to be
    exceeded as a result of racing requests. It defaults to True, which makes
    it impossible for a user to exceed their quota. However, it will be
    possible for a REST API user to be rejected with an over quota 403 error
    response in the event of a collision close to reaching their quota limit,
    even if the user has enough quota available when they made the request.
    Operators may want to set the option to False to avoid additional load on
    the system if allowing quota to be exceeded because of racing requests is
    considered acceptable.
