features:
  - Add a nova-manage command to refresh the quota
    usages for a project or user.  This can be used
    when the usages in the quota-usages database table
    are out-of-sync with the actual usages.  For example,
    if a resource usage is at the limit in the quota_usages
    table, but the actual usage is less, then nova will
    not allow VMs to be created for that project or user.
    The nova-manage command can be used to re-sync
    the quota_usages table with the actual usage.
