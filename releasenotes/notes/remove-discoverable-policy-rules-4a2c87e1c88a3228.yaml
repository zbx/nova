    All policy rules with the following naming scheme have been
    removed: ``os_compute_api:{extension_alias}:discoverable``
    These policy rules were used to hide an enabled extension from the
    list active API extensions API. Given it is no longer possible to
    disable any API extensions, it makes no sense to have the option
    to hide the fact an API extension is active. As such, all these policy
    rules have been removed.
