upgrade:
  - |
    The ``nova.virt.libvirt.volume.glusterfs.LibvirtGlusterfsVolumeDriver``
    volume driver has been removed. The GlusterFS volume driver in Cinder was
    deprecated during the Newton release and was removed from Cinder in the
    Ocata release so it is effectively not maintained and therefore no longer
    supported.

    The following configuration options, previously found in the ``libvirt``
    group, have been removed:

    - ``glusterfs_mount_point_base``
    - ``qemu_allowed_storage_drivers``

    These were used by the now-removed ``LibvirtGlusterfsVolumeDriver`` volume
    driver and therefore no longer had any effect.
