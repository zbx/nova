upgrade:
    - The legacy v2 API code was deprecated since Liberty release. The legacy
      v2 API code was removed in Newton release. We suggest that users should
      move to v2.1 API which compatible v2 API with more restrict input
      validation and microversions support. If users are still looking for v2
      compatible API before switch to v2.1 API, users can use v2.1 API code as
      v2 API compatible mode. That compatible mode is closer to v2 API
      behaviour which is v2 API compatible without restrict input validation
      and microversions support. So if using openstack_compute_api_legacy_v2
      in /etc/nova/api-paste.ini for the API endpoint /v2, users need to switch
      the endpoint to openstack_compute_api_v21_legacy_v2_compatible instead.
