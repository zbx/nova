    The disabled ``os-pci`` API has been removed. This API was originally added
    to the v3 API which over time finally became the v2.1 API and the initial
    microversion is backward compatible with the v2.0 API, where the
    ``os-pci`` extension did not exist. The ``os-pci`` API was never enabled
    as a microversion in the v2.1 API and at this time no longer aligns with
    Nova strategically and is therefore just technical debt, so it has been
    removed. Since it was never enabled or exposed out of the compute REST API
    endpoint there was no deprecation period for this.
