    XenServer users must now set the value of xenserver.ovs_integration_bridge before they
    can use the system. Previously this had a default of "xapi1", which has now been
    removed, because it is dependent on the environment. The xapi<n> are internal bridges
    that are incrementally defined from zero and "xapi1" may not be the correct bridge.
    Operators should set this config value to the integration bridge used between all
    guests and the compute host in their environment.
