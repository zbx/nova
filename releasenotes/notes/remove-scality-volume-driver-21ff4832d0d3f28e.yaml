upgrade:
  - |
    The ``nova.virt.libvirt.volume.scality.LibvirtScalityVolumeDriver`` volume
    driver has been removed. The Scality volume driver in Cinder was deprecated
    during the Newton release and was removed from Cinder in the Ocata release
    so it is effectively not maintained and therefore no longer supported.
  - |
    The following configuration options, previously found in the ``libvirt``
    group, have been removed:

    - ``scality_sofs_config``
    - ``scality_sofs_mount_point``

    These were used by the now-removed ``LibvirtScalityVolumeDriver`` volume
    driver and therefore no longer had any effect.
