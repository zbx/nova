upgrade:
  - In mitaka, an online migration was added to migrate older SRIOV parent
    device information from extra_info to a new column. Since two releases
    have gone out with that migration, it is removed in Ocata and operators
    are expetected to have run it as part of either of the previous two
    releases, if applicable.
