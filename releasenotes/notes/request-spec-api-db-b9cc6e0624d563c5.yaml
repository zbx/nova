    The commit with change-id Idd4bbbe8eea68b9e538fa1567efd304e9115a02a
    requires that the nova_api database is setup and Nova is configured to use
    it.  Instructions on doing that are provided below.

    Nova now requires that two databases are available and configured.  The
    existing nova database needs no changes, but a new nova_api database needs
    to be setup.  It is configured and managed very similarly to the nova
    database.  A new connection string configuration option is available in the
    api_database group.  An example::

        [api_database]
        connection = mysql+pymysql://user:secret@127.0.0.1/nova_api?charset=utf8

    And a new nova-manage command has been added to manage db migrations for
    this database.  "nova-manage api_db sync" and "nova-manage api_db version"
    are available and function like the parallel "nova-manage db ..." version.
