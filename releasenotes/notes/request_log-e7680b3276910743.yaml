    A new request_log middleware is created to log REST HTTP requests
    even if Nova API is not running under eventlet.wsgi. Because this
    is an api-paste.ini change, you will need to manually update your
    api-paste.ini with the one from the release to get this
    functionality. The new request logs will only emit when it is
    detected that nova-api is not running under eventlet, and will
    include the microversion of the request in addition to all the
    previously logged information.
