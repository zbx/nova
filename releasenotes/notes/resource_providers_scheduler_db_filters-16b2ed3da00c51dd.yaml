features:
  - nova-scheduler process is now calling the placement API in order to get
    a list of valid destinations before calling the filters. That works only
    if all your compute nodes are fully upgraded to Ocata. If some
    nodes are not upgraded, the scheduler will still lookup from the DB
    instead which is less performant.
upgrade:
  - Since the Placement service is now mandatory in Ocata, you need to deploy
    it and amend your compute node configuration with correct placement
    instructions before restarting nova-compute or the compute node will
    refuse to start.
  - If by Newton (14.0.0), you don't use any of the CoreFilter, RamFilter or
    DiskFilter, then please modify all your compute node's configuration by
    amending either ``cpu_allocation_ratio`` (if you don't use CoreFilter) or
    ``ram_allocation_ratio`` (if you don't use RamFilter) or
    ``disk_allocation_ratio`` (if you don't use DiskFilter) by putting a 9999.0
    value for the ratio before upgrading the nova-scheduler to Ocata.
