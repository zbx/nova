fixes:
  - Physical network name will be retrieved from a multi-segement network.
    The current implementation will retrieve the physical network name for the
    first segment that provides it. This is mostly intended to support a
    combinatin of vxlan and vlan segments. Additional work will be required to
    support a case of multiple vlan segments associated with different
    physical networks.
