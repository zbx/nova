upgrade:
  - |
    The ``nova-manage api_db sync`` and ``nova-manage db sync`` commands
    previously took an optional ``--version`` parameter to determine which
    version to sync to. For example::

        $ nova-manage api_db sync --version some-version

    This is now an optional positional argument. For example::

        $ nova-manage api_db sync some-version

    Aliases are provided but these are marked as deprecated and will be removed
    in the next release of nova.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``--version`` parameters of the ``nova-manage api_db sync`` and
    ``nova-manage db sync`` commands has been deprecated in favor of
    positional arguments.
