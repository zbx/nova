upgrade:
  - The ability to load a custom scheduler host manager via the
    ``scheduler_host_manager`` configuration option was deprecated
    in the 13.0.0 Mitaka release and is now removed in the 14.0.0 Newton
    release. Host managers can only be selected by name and not by full
    class path. The allowed values are ``host_manager`` and
    ``ironic_host_manager``.
