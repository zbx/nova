upgrade:
  - DB2 database support was removed from tree. This is a non open
    source database that had no 3rd party CI, and a set of constraints
    that meant we had to keep special casing it in code. It also made
    the online data migrations needed for cells v2 and placement
    engine much more difficult. With 0% of OpenStack survey users
    reporting usage we decided it was time to remove this to focus on
    features needed by the larger community.
