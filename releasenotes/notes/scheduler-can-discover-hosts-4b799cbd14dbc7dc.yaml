  - As new hosts are added to Nova, the `nova-manage cell_v2
    discover_hosts` command must be run in order to map them into
    their cell. For deployments with proper automation, this is a
    trivial extra step in that process. However, for smaller or
    non-automated deployments, there is a new configuration variable
    for the scheduler process which will perform this discovery
    periodically. By setting
    `scheduler.discover_hosts_in_cells_interval` to a positive value,
    the scheduler will handle this for you. Note that this process
    involves listing all hosts in all cells, and is likely to be too
    heavyweight for large deployments to run all the time.
