deprecations:
  - |
    The CachingScheduler and ChanceScheduler drivers are deprecated in Pike.
    These are not integrated with the placement service, and their primary
    purpose (speed over correctness) should be addressed by the default
    FilterScheduler going forward. If ChanceScheduler behavior is desired
    (i.e. speed trumps correctness) then configuring the FilterScheduler with
    no enabled filters should approximate that behavior.
