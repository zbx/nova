    The scheduler now requests allocation candidates from the Placement
    service during scheduling. The allocation candidates information
    was introduced in the Placement API 1.10 microversion, so you should
    upgrade the placement service before the Nova scheduler service so that
    the scheduler can take advantage of the allocation candidate
    information.
