    In deployments with multiple (v2) cells, upcalls from the computes to the scheduler
    (or other control services) cannot occur. This prevents certain things from happening,
    such as the track_instance_changes updates, as well as the late affinity checks for
    server groups. See the related documentation on the `scheduler.track_instance_changes`
    and `workarounds.disable_group_policy_check_upcall` configuration options for more
    details. Single-cell deployments without any MQ isolation will continue to operate as
    they have for the time being.
