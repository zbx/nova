fixes:
  - To make live-migration consistent with resize, confirm-resize and
    revert-resize operations, the migration status is changed to 'error'
    instead of 'failed' in case of live-migration failure. With this change
    the periodic task '_cleanup_incomplete_migrations' is now able to remove
    orphaned instance files from compute nodes in case of live-migration
    failures. There is no impact since migration status 'error' and
    'failed' refer to the same failed state.
