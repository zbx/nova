features:
  - Two new policies soft-affinity and soft-anti-affinity have been implemented
    for the server-group feature of Nova. This means that
        POST  /v2.1/{tenant_id}/os-server-groups
    API resource now accepts 'soft-affinity' and 'soft-anti-affinity' as value
    of the 'policies' key of the request body.
