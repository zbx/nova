    Adds support to OVS vif type with direct port (SR-IOV).
    In order to use this OVS acceleration mode, ``openvswitch`` 2.8.0
    and 'Linux Kernel' 4.8 are required. This feature allows control of
    an SR-IOV virtual function (VF) via OpenFlow control plane and gain
    improved performance of 'Open vSwitch'. Please note that in Pike
    release we can't differentiate between SR-IOV hardware and OVS offloaded
    on the same host. This limitation should be resolved when the
    enable-sriov-nic-features will be completed.
    Until then operators can use host aggregates to ensure that they can
    schedule instances on specific hosts based on hardware.
