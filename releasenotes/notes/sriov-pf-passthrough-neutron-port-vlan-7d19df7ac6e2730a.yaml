    VLAN tags associated with instance network interfaces are now exposed via
    the metadata API and instance config drives and can be consumed by the
    instance. This is an extension of the device tagging mechanism added in
    past releases. This is useful for instances utilizing SR-IOV physical
    functions (PFs). The VLAN configuration for the guest's virtual interfaces
    associated with these devices cannot be configured inside the guest OS from
    the host, but nonetheless must be configured with the VLAN tags of the
    device to ensure packet delivery. This feature makes this possible.

    .. note:: VLAN tags are currently only supported via the Libvirt driver.
