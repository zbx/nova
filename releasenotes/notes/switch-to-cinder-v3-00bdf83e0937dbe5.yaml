    Nova is now configured to use the v3 version of the Cinder API. You need to
    ensure that the v3 version of the Cinder API is available and listed in the
    service catalog in order to use Nova with the default configuration option.

    The base ``3.0`` version is identical to v2 and it was introduced in the
    Newton release of OpenStack. In case you need Nova to continue using the v2
    version you can point it towards that by setting the ``catalog_info``
    option in the ``nova.conf`` file under the ``cinder`` section, like::

        [cinder]
        catalog_info = volumev2:cinderv2:publicURL
