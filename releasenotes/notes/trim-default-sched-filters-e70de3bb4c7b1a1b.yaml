    Since we now use Placement to verify basic CPU/RAM/disk resources when
    using the FilterScheduler, the ``RamFilter`` and ``DiskFilter`` entries are
    being removed from the default value for the ``enabled_filters`` config
    option in the ``[filter_scheduler]`` group.  If you are overriding this
    option, you probably should remove them from your version.  If you are
    using CachingScheduler you may wish to enable these filters as we will
    not use Placement in that case.
