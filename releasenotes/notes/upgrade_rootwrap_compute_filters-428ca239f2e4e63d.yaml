upgrade:
  - Upgrade the rootwrap configuration for the compute service,
    so that patches requiring new rootwrap configuration can be
    tested with grenade.
fixes:
  - In a race condition if base image is deleted by ImageCacheManager
    while imagebackend is copying the image to instance path, then the
    instance goes in to error state. In this case when libvirt has
    changed the base file ownership to libvirt-qemu while imagebackend
    is copying the image, then we get permission denied error on updating
    the file access time using os.utime. Fixed this issue by updating the
    base file access time with root user privileges using 'touch' command.
