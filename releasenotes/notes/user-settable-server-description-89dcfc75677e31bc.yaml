  - In Nova Compute API microversion 2.19, you can
    specify a "description" attribute when creating, rebuilding, or updating
    a server instance.  This description can be retrieved by getting
    server details, or list details for servers.

    Refer to the Nova Compute API documentation for more
    information.

    Note that the description attribute existed in prior
    Nova versions, but was set to the server name by Nova,
    and was not visible to the user.  So, servers you
    created with microversions prior to 2.19 will return
    the description equals the name on server details
    microversion 2.19.
