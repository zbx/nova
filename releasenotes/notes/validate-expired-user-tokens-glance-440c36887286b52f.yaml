    Added support for Keystone middleware feature for interaction of Nova with
    the Glance API. With this support, if service token is sent along with the
    user token, then the expiration of user token will be ignored. In order to
    use this functionality a service user needs to be created first.
    Add the service user configurations in ``nova.conf`` under ``service_user``
    group and set ``send_service_user_token`` flag to ``True``.

    .. note:: This feature is already implemented for Nova interaction with the
      Cinder and Neutron APIs in Ocata.
