    The vendordata metadata system now caches boot time roles.  Some external
    vendordata services want to provide metadata based on the role of the user
    who started the instance. It would be confusing if the metadata returned
    changed later if the role of the user changed, so we cache the boot time
    roles and then pass those to the external vendordata service.
