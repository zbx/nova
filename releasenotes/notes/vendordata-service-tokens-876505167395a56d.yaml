    The nova metadata service will now pass a nove service token to the
    external vendordata server. These options can be configured using various
    Keystone-related options available in the ``vendordata_dynamic_auth``
    group. A new service token has been created for this purpose. Previously,
    the requesting user's keystone token was passed through to the external
    vendordata server if available, otherwise no token is passed. This resolves
    issues with scenarios such as cloud-init's use of the metadata server on
    first boot to determine configuration information.  Refer to the blueprints
    at
    http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/ocata/approved/vendordata-reboot-ocata.html
    for more information.
