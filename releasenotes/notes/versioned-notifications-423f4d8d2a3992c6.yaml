features:
  - As part of refactoring the notification interface of Nova
    a new config option 'notification_format' has been added to specifies
    which notification format shall be used by nova. The possible values
    are 'unversioned' (e.g. legacy), 'versioned', 'both'. The default
    value is 'both'.
    The new versioned notifications are documented in
    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/notifications.html
