fixes:
  - When plugging virtual interfaces of type vhost-user the MTU value will
    not be applied to the interface by nova. vhost-user ports exist only in
    userspace and are not backed by kernel netdevs, for this reason it is
    not possible to set the mtu on a vhost-user interface using standard
    tools such as ifconfig or ip link.
