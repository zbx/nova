features:
  - When using libvirt driver, vrouter VIFs (OpenContrail) now supports
    multiqueue mode, which allows to scale network performance across number
    of vCPUs. To use this feature one needs to create instance with more than
    1 vCPU from an image with ``hw_vif_multiqueue_enabled`` property set to
    ``true``.
