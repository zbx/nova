upgrade:
  - XenServer plugins have been renamed to include a '.py' extension. Code has
    been included to handle plugins with and without the extension, but this
    will be removed in the next release. The plugins with the extension should
    be deployed on all compute nodes to mitigate any upgrade issues.
