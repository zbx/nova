    The Zookeeper Service Group driver has been removed.

    The driver has no known users and is not actively maintained. A warning log
    message about the driver's state was added for the Kilo release. Also,
    evzookeeper library that the driver depends on is unmaintained and
    `incompatible with recent eventlet releases`_.

    A future release of Nova will `use the Tooz library to track
    service liveliness`_, and Tooz supports Zookeeper.
